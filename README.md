# Contest Archive
This repository contains a comprehensive archive for all the programming
contests I have participated in. The listed codes are specifically written to
suit the unique environment of a programming contest which prioritizes
conciseness and efficiency, oftentimes at the expense of compromising general
good programming practices. Thus, they are in no way whatsoever representative
of my actual coding style and should only be viewed as proof of my knack for
problem solving and mastery of complex algorithms and data structures.

Below are the list of online judges I have been part of:

* [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/)

* [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)

* [CodeChef](http://codechef.com/)

* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

* [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)
